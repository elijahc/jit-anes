## ANESTHESIA ROTATION SCHEDULING

We use [QGenda](https://www.qgenda.com) for all resident scheduling. This can be accessed on your phone via the app or online at www.qgenda.com. You will get access granted at orientation from Anesthesia Education administration.

QGenda is the place to check your schedule while you are on anesthesia rotations. Program may seem cumbersome at first, but you will get very comfortable with QGenda as it is what we use all of residency!

While on your anesthesia blocks, you will rotate through the STICU, CTICU, Acute pain service, General OR at UCH, Chronic Pain, Preprocedural Services. See rotation specifics below:

Disclaimer: day to day hours may vary on each rotation!

For specifics regarding the day-to-day details of these rotations, please refer to their respective sections within the green book.

## GENERAL ADVICE FOR INTERN YEAR

### STEP 3:

You should receive a total of $*** in study materials for intern year in education funds from Anesthesia Department. You will need to show a receipt to Anesthesia education; can only be -- that. Most IM intern groups will have discounted group buy-ins for ~$400 for 6 months Uworld.

Step 3 should be completed ideally before end of March of academic year. For ease of scheduling please take exam on anesthesia-based rotations (i.e. STICU, CTICU, APS, PPS, Gen OR)
