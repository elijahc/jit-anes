## Overview
The CTICU is split up between two provider teams (Red/Blue) each with their own attending. Attendings rotate
on a weekly basis changing over each Monday. The attendings alternate days for admissions. You will bounce
between teams (sometimes split between teams) based on which patients you are assigned. Typically, the APPs
will send out a text the night before with the next day’s patient assignments. Generally, the CTICU is well
staffed. You will typically be assigned 3-4 patients during the day. 

## Daily Workflow

Most days follow the same pattern, first thing in the morning is fellow rounds with the CT Surgery fellow, 
followed by pre-rounding, ICU/Attending rounds, then everything else before signout at 4p.

### Fellow rounds
Arrive around 5:45 – 6:00 AM depending on the census. I overnight resident will have
printed off a sign out list for you and filled in many of the numbers (Vitals, Swan numbers, I/Os) The
overnight residents/APP will then present all the cardiac patients on fellow rounds. The night resident 
will briefly present cardiac patients ONLY to the cardiac fellow. – There you will
hear a brief daily plan from the fellow/night resident. Thereafter, the night resident
will give sign out on the rest of the unit patients (Thoracic and Vascular patients)
and answer any questions.

> [!TIP]
> Goal of 2-3 mins per patient
> - One liner with notable 24H events
> - Remains in the ICU for the following
> - Resp status (how much NC or vent settings)
> - Review of vasoactives
> - Overall I/O total and did we hit our goal; what's our diuresis plan, is CRRT something like we need to consider?
> - Drains in place with outputs and how we will manage them
> - Pacing wires present? How will we manage them?
> - Pertinent labs: CBC, coags, SCr, ABG
> - AC plans?
> - Finally, high-priority, patient specific items if needed 

### Pre-rounds
You then have time between fellow rounds and attending rounds to completely lookup and
familiarize yourself with your patients. Including: talking to their RN, performing a quick and focused
exam, reviewing patient data (labs, I/Os) in EPIC, starting the daily progress note and write any urgent
orders (transfuse, electrolytes replacement, etc.); always try to glance at the daily CXR before rounds.
Make sure everyone is seen by the time rounds start. There are rare days where you will be assigned more or less.

### Attending rounds
CTICU attending rounds start around 8 AM and the length is quite variable 
depending on the attending, ranging from brief to comprehensive (surgical attendings prefer brevity).

> [!TIP]
> **Presentations**:
> - Start with Name, POD# s/p surgery. Note any significant intraoperative events.
> - Then significant 24hr events.
> - Then jump to Assessment/Plan by system (Neuro-including sedation/pain, CV, Pulm, Renal, ID, Endo, FEN.
> - Finish with review of invasive lines, meds and dispo.

## Shifts
There are essentially 4 types of shifts: Weekday rounding (6AM-4PM), Admitting M-F (10AM-10PM), Weekday night call (4PM-7AM), Weekend
24h call (7AM-7AM)

### Weekday Rounding
6AM-4PM, you should plan on arriving shortly before fellow rounds. The 
overnight resident/APP will present the cardiac patients, so you don’t need to worry about fully looking 
up your patients prior to fellow rounds. Fellow rounds will begin at 6 AM T/W and 6:30 AM M/Th/F. 
Fellow rounds are BRIEF and typically take 2- 5 minutes per patient. The presentation should be 
concise and focus on drips (inotropes, vasopressors), drains, line, and wire management. The fellows 
will make decisions on which drains to pull based on your I/O info. Pay close attention to the location of 
the drains, typically mediastinal or pleural (sided R or L).

### Admitting
Weekdays 10AM-10PM: When you are assigned an admitting shift 
(generally a few times per month), you arrive at 10AM, check the OR board or that 
days cardiac/thoracic cases destined for the CTICU. Check in with some of the 
APPs they usually know the latest info about the cases. You will then prep the handoff, put in ICU 
admission orders and await the new admits arrival. You will admit the days post-op patients, stabilize 
and cross-cover them until signout around 10PM. If it is slow and no other patient on the unit is 
crashing, you may be able to sign out early.

### Weekday Night Call
Shift begins at 4PM, you split the list with an APP or surgery moonlighter and get 
signout. At approx. 10PM or earlier if it is slow, the admitting provider will sign out the days admits for 
you to cross-cover overnight. If any admits come in after the admitter goes home, you are responsible 
for admitting (alternating with APP/moonlighter) and staffing with the attending overnight.

### Weekend 24h Call
Shift is 7AM- ~8AM the following day. Arrive shortly before 7AM for fellow 
rounds with the overnight team. You will split the unit with 1-2 APPs. You will round and carry out 
duties as normal. You will split daytime and overnight admissions with the other provider on the unit. 
At 4PM the day APP signs out and you will split the list with either another APP or a general surgery 
moonlighter. Fellow rounds begin the next day at 7AM on Sunday and 6:30 AM on Monday. You are 
responsible for pulling drains/tubes/wires as discussed on fellow rounds prior to going home.

## Call Schedule
It isQ4 call in the CTICU. Weekday call shifts start @ 4 pm. You will get sign-out from the day team and then
cross-cover those patients until the morning. The weekday admitter will sign out the days new admits to you
around 10 PM (potentially earlier if it is slow). You will present the cardiac patients at fellow rounds in the
morning and sign out thoracic patients directly to the day resident/APP covering those patients. For weekend
24h call you arrive on Sat/Sun at 7AM with fellow rounds shortly to follow. The overnight resident is then
allowed to go home, and the day resident and one or more APP split up the unit. The APP will typically stay
until around 4pm on weekends when a general surgery moonlighter arrives, at that point you re-distribute the
unit for overnight coverage.
