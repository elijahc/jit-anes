## What is a greenbook?
Great question. I think originally the idea was inspired by 
"[The Negro Motorist Green Book](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00212275098/?sp=1&r=-1.059,-0.049,3.119,1.543,0)". 
Also referred to as just the Green Book, it was part travel 
guide and part survival guide intended to help african american 
travelers get from place to place safely in the 1930s era of Jim Crow laws. 
I think senior residents from different specialties adopted the spirit of 
this insiders guide as a way to pass on knowledge about the logistics and 
mechanics of clinical rotations. Things you should get an orientation on 
or an email about when starting a new rotation like where to be and when
but are expected to just know. Or maybe it's just because they originally
printed it with a green cover. At least the one I received at IM intern orientation
was. Now its just a pdf.

## Whats wrong with the current greenbook
It's a monolith. A 137 page 2MB pdf, hardly pocket sized. It probably exists on my phone somewhere but I'm not sure where.
If you throught scrolling through that on a computer was a pain, its even worse on a smart phone.
So for years it lived in my email somewhere buried. Most of the time when I wanted info out of it
it was a pain (logging into email, 2FA, searching, trying to load 2Mb pdf). 



So I started building it as a static site blog / wiki. Why is this better? Sharing it is just texting a link.
It has built in search. Anyone can help update it. You can share just a specific section by link.
You can just open browser on a computer in the OR and type in the address.
Updating it easier too, you can just edit the page. No need to request the
original .docx file to edit and export. And its mobile friendly. Easy
to read on your smartphone.
